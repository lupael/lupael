## 🧑‍💼 Experience

With over 13 years in senior networking and security roles, I have supported complex network infrastructures globally and domestically.
I have obtained a number of industry certifications from organizations such as **Cisco, Mikrotik, APNIC, Microsoft, and Citrix**. I currently support a number of critical networks for a diverse range of customers across industries including ISP, universities, healthcare, and defense. My services are often called upon by other IT solution providers to resolve complex networking issues that their internal support staff have been unable to resolve.
